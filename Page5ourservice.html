                            <p>Photography is a technology for recording an image by registering optical radiation using a photosensitive photographic material or a semiconductor converter. Unlike some other languages, in Russian the word “photography” is used only in relation to still images. At the same time, in professional cinematography, this term refers to the pictorial solution of a film created by a cinematographer. Photographs also refers to the final prints of a photographic image, produced on photographic paper by a chemical method or by a printer.</p>

                            <p>Creativity is a person's ability to make creative decisions, understand, accept and create fundamentally new ideas. In everyday life, creativity is manifested as ingenuity - the ability to achieve a goal, find a way out of a seemingly hopeless situation, using the environment, objects and circumstances in an unusual way.                      
                            In a broad sense, it is a non-trivial and ingenious solution to a problem, and, as a rule, with non-specialized tools or resources. It also refers to the ability to bold, non-standard solutions to problems.</p>

                            <p>Web design is a type of graphic design aimed at the development and design of objects of the information environment of the Internet, designed to provide them with high consumer properties and aesthetic qualities. Such an interpretation separates web design from web programming, emphasizes the specificity of the subject activity of a web designer, and positions web design as a type of graphic design.
                            At present, the term web design is understood precisely as the design of the structure of a web resource, ensuring the convenience of using the resource for users.</p>
